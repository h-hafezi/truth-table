//! Data-dependent proof-plan optimizer rules.
//!
//! Parallel to [`crate::data_dependent_lp_optimizer`], but operates on the
//! truth-table IR (`InitialIr<B>`) after the structural
//! [`crate::pp_optimizer`] pass. Rules in this module make decisions that
//! depend on runtime information only the prover sees, emit
//! [`ProofPlanOptimizationHint`]s, and the verifier replays those hints to
//! reproduce the prover's IR shape.
//!
//! The list is currently empty — this module exists as wiring for future
//! rules. When the first rule lands, the implementer should:
//!
//!  1. Add a variant to [`ProofPlanOptimizationHint`].
//!  2. Push a `Arc<RuleStruct>` into [`rules`].
//!  3. Extend [`apply_proof_plan_optimization_hints`] to dispatch on the new
//!     variant.
//!  4. Plumb [`ProofPlanOptimizationHints`] into the [`TTProof`]
//!     serialization so the verifier receives them.
