# Run the three micro-benchmark suites (PoSQL, QEDB, TruthTable) on the
# shared Filter / Aggregate / Limit / Join / Join_PK_FK queries, and emit
# both raw stdout logs and structured per-bench JSON files.
#
# Outputs to tt-results/raw/:
#   third_party_{bench}.log   — full cargo bench stdout (one per system)
#   third_party_{bench}.json  — parsed/structured results (one per system)
#
# The per-bench JSONs are what parse_micro.py consumes; the logs are kept for
# debugging.
#
# Thread pinning: NUM_THREADS (default 1) is propagated as RAYON_NUM_THREADS
# (consumed by Rayon) AND TT_BENCH_NUM_THREADS (stamped into the JSON output
# by parse_bench_output.py). The two MUST match — otherwise micro.csv lies
# about what was measured.
#
# Failures in one bench don't abort the others.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tt-results/scripts/run_micro.sh

# QEDB regenerates its setup keys / cache on first contact with a fresh
# artifact/size_N directory. That work parallelizes well but is single-
# threaded slow, so we run QEDB ONCE at WARMUP_THREADS just to populate
# `artifact/size_N/qedb_cache/` and discard the timing log. The measured
# pass then runs everything (incl. QEDB again) at NUM_THREADS=1 with the
# cache already warm, so only the prover work is measured single-threaded.
#
# This is idempotent: if qedb_cache/ already exists from a previous invocation
# the warmup is mostly a no-op (QEDB skips work it already has).

# Join + Join_PK_FK parquets share a deterministic PK/FK row layout written
# by sxt's bench and read by the other two. Wipe stale ones so downstream
# benches don't read mismatched data. Filter / Aggregate / Limit parquets
# are independent and reused.
#
# Under MICRO_ONLY_TT=1 the sxt bench that regenerates the Join layout is
# skipped, so keep the existing (deterministic) parquets instead of wiping —
# wiping would strand the TT Join cases with no data source.
